**🏥 Hospital Appointment Booking Data Model System**

A Cloud-Based AI-Powered Healthcare Solution
🚀 Project Overview
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a cloud-based, AI-driven healthcare platform that streamlines patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, medical records, doctor-patient interactions, and real-time analytics. This project is designed for hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers to manage patient care efficiently while ensuring a secure, scalable, and intelligent system.

Even though I am a core Data Science aspirant, I have leveraged advanced AI tools and cloud technologies to develop a full-stack hospital management application without limitations. This project was built using Lovable.AI, Replit, and cloud computing services, making it an intelligent, highly functional, and interactive system.
