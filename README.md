**Hospital Appointment Booking ML** -

Welcome to a cutting-edge, cloud-based healthcare platform that blends AI, real-time analytics, and seamless patient management. This Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed to make healthcare services more efficient, intuitive, and accessible for patients, doctors, and healthcare providers alike. From appointment scheduling to medical records management, this system streamlines every aspect of healthcare delivery, ensuring both patients and staff experience the highest level of care.

Even though my primary focus is data science, I‚Äôve taken a hands-on approach to developing this full-stack hospital management system. By integrating advanced AI tools, cloud technologies, and machine learning, I‚Äôve built a powerful and intelligent platform capable of enhancing hospital operations and patient care.
